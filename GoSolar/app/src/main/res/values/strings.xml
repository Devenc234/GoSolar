    <string name="description_app">Before installing Photovoltaic (PV) panels at a place it is important to estimate the
solar potential of the place. The approaches available in literature for this purpose
do not consider the presence of surrounding obstructions, thus producing wrong
estimates. LiDAR data or 3D GIS based approaches consider the obstructions but
prove cost-effective only at city-wide scales. This paper presents a cost-effective,
accurate, and suitable-to-be-used-by-common people approach for this purpose. The
paper utilizes terrestrial images of the surroundings and identifies the obstructions
present therein. Using the azimuth and elevation angles of the principal axes of
terrestrial images the azimuth and elevation angles of each pixel in these images are
determined. Using thresholding and morphological closing the terrestrial images are
converted into sky and non-sky zones. Sun is only visible at the point of interest if it
lies in the sky zone. The position of the Sun is determined using the model of Grena
(2007). The irradiance reaching the Earth surface is computed using the modified
radiative transfer model of Yang et al. (2001). Finally the total irradiance over a
chosen time period at a given location is estimated by integrating the irradiances
when the Sun is visible. This approach has potential to be used by masses using
their smartphone to estimate the solar potential of their rooftop.</string>
